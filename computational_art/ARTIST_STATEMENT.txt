Artist Statement:

#1 ---  CoyOil

Ahoy!
This work employs the coy,
From the mind of this boy decoy.
Who only finds joy,
When he destroys the soy.

For America toils for the oil,
We cannot find in our soil.
Seeking the royal foil,
Before our country spoils. 




#2 --- Seize the Cheese

To seize the cheese,
is to please the cheese.
And to please the cheese,
is to squeeze the bees knees,
before he sees he will not freeze.
